# App that lets you play the samples of any song on Spotify

### Tech Stack: Express, React, and Node
APIs: Spotify and Genuis

## To get the app running:

1. make sure you have node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. git clone this repo
3. cd into client and server folder and run `npm install` in terminal to install all dependencies
4. in server folder, run `npm run devStart`
5. in client folder, run `npm start`

Will require having a Spotify account. 

Will ask you to sign in to Spotify and you can then search a song you want to listen to. Once you play that song, the Samples should show up on the page and you can then play them. Currently, the app is only logging the Samples of a given song in the console.

## Demo of the app:
listen to the first 10 seconds of Favorite Song by Chance the Rapper (2013) and the first 5 seconds of Clean Up Woman by Betty Wright (1972) to notice the Sample.
